# Changelog

All notable changes to Elementborn are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project aims for [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
`tools/bump-version.sh` rolls the `[Unreleased]` section into a dated version on release.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Online social layer** (backend-agnostic): identity + roles, notifications, feedback-to-admin, friends,
  session invites, direct/session messaging, and role-enforced moderation — all behind seven Core seams with an
  in-memory `LocalSocialBackend`, so it runs and unit-tests offline. `SocialHub` is the single access point.
- **Social UI** (`SocialMenuController`): a toggled in-game overlay (key J) for notifications, friends + invites,
  session chat, a feedback form, and a moderation panel, plus a reusable `UiTheme.Input` text field. Now added to
  the generated bootstrap scene.
- **Interaction arbiter** (`InteractionArbiter` + `IInteractable`): one owner of the Interact button and prompt;
  the five former pollers (world interactor, NPCs, sidekicks, plant control, the frogs) became offerers, ending
  the shared-button conflict.
- **Editor bootstrap generator**: one-click build of a playable scene + first-person / third-person / VR rig
  prefabs (Elementborn ▸ Bootstrap).
- **Material generator**: cel-shaded `.mat` assets from the toon shaders (Elementborn ▸ Materials), auto-applied
  to the generated rigs and ground, with a `SceneStyleController` for sky/ambient/fog in the scene.
- **Netcode (Nakama)**: client adapters for all seven seams behind the `ELEMENTBORN_NAKAMA` define, a server
  runtime module (feedback-to-admin, trusted notify, authoritative sessions, and a ban-gated match join), a local
  `docker-compose`, and the build/load setup.
- **VR comfort locomotion** (`VrComfortLocomotion`): snap/smooth turn, stick movement, recenter and height reset,
  driving the existing comfort vignette; the generated VR rig is now an XR-origin shape.
- **Project doctor** (`tools/doctor.sh`): one command asserting every invariant — gates, IP, `#if` balance,
  asmdef validity, the Element enum, retired tokens, and doc/test-count sync.
- Release pipeline: the `VERSION` file, this changelog, `tools/bump-version.sh`, `tools/validate.sh`, and the
  `release` and `docs` GitHub Actions workflows; `tools/ip-guard.sh` + `tools/validate.sh` wired into CI.
- Docs: `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `NETCODE.md`, `VR_SETUP.md`, `SOCIAL.md`, `LIMITATIONS.md`.

### Changed
- `SocialHub` builds its services from a swappable `ISocialBackend` (local by default, Nakama under the define).
- `Health.SetMax` resizes in place instead of replacing the object, so external Damaged/Died subscribers survive.
- Faction "Republicers" renamed to "Synodists"; a trademark sweep across shaders and docs; `Notification.MarkRead()`
  made public so backend stores can mark read.
- EditMode test files: 44 → 50 (social phases, the backend swap, the arbiter, cross-service hardening).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22
### Added
- Initial cross-platform scaffold from one Unity 6 (URP) codebase: VR / flat / third-person elemental combat,
  character creation with a gacha roll, and the cel-shaded look.
- A seeded open world — regions, biomes, low-poly terrain, and POI-driven structures.
- Bestiary and rare companions, mounts and vehicles, economy / taming, weather and day-night, the HUD,
  interaction prompts, and slot-aware saving.
- The arena and underwater layers, VR motion combat with a stance layer, and four hidden signature moves.
- Joinable factions, interactive plants, exotic apex creatures with two-element mix attacks, the three guide
  NPCs with Willow's sidekick menagerie, the evolution mode, and data-driven modding.
- 44 EditMode test files plus PlayMode tests, a GameCI workflow, the cel-shaded shader suite, and the full
  documentation set under `docs/`.
